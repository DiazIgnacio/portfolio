<h2>This is my personal portfolio that I developed using Next.js and React.</h2>

I'm a web developer and I love experimenting with new technologies. I started learning React in early 2020 and I was hooked. I think React is a great framework because it's simple and easy to learn, but it also has a lot of power and flexibility.

I decided to create a personal portfolio using Next.js and React because I wanted to learn more about these technologies and see how they work together. I also wanted to create a portfolio that would be easy to update and maintain.

I'm really happy with how my portfolio turned out. I think it looks great and it's been a lot of fun to work on. I plan to continue updating and improving it over time. If you want to contact me, you can find my email address and other contact information on my website.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. I hope you find it helpful and informative.
